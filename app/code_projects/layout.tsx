        <p>Here is all of my programming and design work, showcasing my technical skills and focus on user
             experience. I developed games using C++ and SFML in my first year of IDAD and another game in
              JavaScript during my second year. Iâ€™ve also worked on websites both inside and outside SETU,
               using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout these projects, I combined coding with UX
             research and UI design to create user-friendly, accessible interfaces that enhance usability.</p>
