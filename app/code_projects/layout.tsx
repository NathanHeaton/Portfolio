        <p>Here is all of my programming and design work, showcasing my technical skills and focus on user
             experience. I developed games using C++ and SFML in my first year of IDAD and another game in
              JavaScript during my second year. I’ve also worked on websites both inside and outside SETU,
               using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout these projects, I combined coding with UX
             research and UI design to create user-friendly, accessible interfaces that enhance usability.</p>
