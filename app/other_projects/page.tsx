            <p>This section highlights some of my work outside of art and coding. I’ve composed and produced several songs using FL Studio, which are available on SoundCloud. Additionally, I’ve participated in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, with plans to attend more in the future as I continue expanding my skills in cybersecurity and problem-solving.</p>
